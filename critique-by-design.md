# Untangling a web (or net, if you will)...
For this assignment I chose to look at this very complicated line chart by the folks at [Icy Data](https://www.icydata.hockey/vizzes/attendance/17). The chart looks at average NHL attendance, by team, over a period of 7 seasons.
I chose to work on this chart because another one of my passions is hockey, and working with a measure like average attendance is a common thread between sports and the arts.


## My initial thoughts
The audience for this chart appears to be fellow hockey fans interested in learning the trends of their favorite team's at-home attendance over time. This data would also be significant for team ownership, staff of the venue, prospective season ticket buyers, local governments for the cities the teams play in, and the league executives. 
I found this chart to be very hard to read. A few things I noted were...

-  The random use of color throughout the lines. The creator of this viz didn't even use the colors of the teams to connect the logos together.
-  Speaking of the logos, they are eye-catching, but distracting seeing them every single year. Since the images are so large, we are also not getting to see all of the data points. It's a good thing that there is a filter to sort by team.
