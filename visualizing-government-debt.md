# Visualizing Government Debt

## What are we looking at?
This series of data visualizations represents the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio for several countries around the world from 1995 to 2019. This ratio is often used to indicate a government's financial stability (or lack thereof). The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) presents this data in four ways on their website. 

- A static bar chart that represents these ratios for a single year
- A line chart that a user can highlight specific countries on
- A table with year-by-year data of a country's debt
- A world map with dots of various sizes to indicate the size of a country's debt

I've attached the bar chart with 2019's numbers here for you to look at. I chose to disable the country highlights to focus on the overall form of the chart (also, because after playing around with it a little bit, I realized that the colors are arbitrary and just something meant to pull your eye). The chart is sorted in a way that is predictable and easy to read, with the values being sorted in ascending order. With the graph's interactive component of being able to roll over a bar to get the country name and exact percentage of the country's ratio, the x-axis labels and gridlines on the y-axis are unnecessary. This bar chart would be most useful for
