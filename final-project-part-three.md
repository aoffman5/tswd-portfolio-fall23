# Changes made since Part II
The first and most obvious change is that I created three new infographics to help tell my story. I wanted to address the rising tuition trend as mentioned by one of my users from Part II, and I needed to fill in the gap that I had flagged was present during part II for my visualizations on the industry effect. I chose to turn the potential consequences of the end of affirmative action into an infographic, then I used the Census data to create an infographic on white representation on professional stages and in the general American population. Because of my new visualizations, I was able to shorten some of my text blocks.

Next, I got some feedback after my final class presentation to clear up my donut chart. I got the feedback that greying out two categories of expenses made them seem like they belonged together. This was not my intent, so what I did was I used pastel shades of the two main expenses to show a relationship but not overpower the chart with too much color. 

I added some spacers between my text blocks to try and make them align with the visualizations better, so the reader can get more information about the visualization while having easier access to it. 

On the subject of color, I also changed the colors of the bar chart for application fees to fit the overall color palette of my data story (warm tones, with a bit of purple). 


## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

I think that based on the feedback I received from my user research, my audience seemed clear: I want to focus this presentation on the general public and university administrators while providing information that is relevant to people going through the musical theatre audition process. This was purposeful because with decisions like tuition for some of these programs, the buck stops at the university administration, not necessarily at department heads. While my primary call to action is still to the general public to support non-profits like TFCA to help bridge the gap, I wanted to also include a secondary call to action to university administrators as donating to a fund like this could be potentially construed as a conflict of interest. 

## References
For my visualizations relating to cost, I had to take a slightly unconventional approach to compile the data I needed. For the bar charts about the cost of applications to the schools and tuition and housing costs, I pulled these figures from the Admissions and Financial Aid pages for each school. I either used the full "cost of living" figures that the schools provided (AMDA and NYU had numbers like this), or I calculated it manually by finding a room + board package similar to a traditional first-year experience (dormitory living with a meal plan). 

Here are those citations!
