# About me
Hi! I'm Ashley Offman (she/her), and I am a second year in the Master of Arts Management program at CMU. I come from a theatre performance background, and before CMU, I got my BFA in Musical Theatre! I still love to sing and dance and I perform whenever I get the chance. Outside of theatre, I love to watch reality TV (*currently re-watching Dance Moms while I wait for the next season of Dancing With The Stars*), work out, cook, and play video games. I particularly enjoy Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. I think I need to change my avatar's outfit, but it could just be the hairstyle. What do you think?

# What I hope to learn
I have never taken a data visualization course before, so here is what I hope to learn!
- How to use color more effectively
- Best practices for finding data in my field
- How to simplify graphs and charts but keep them impactful

I want to be able to use these skills in the theatre to create appealing illustrations of attendance figures, donation trends, or even to show the most popular methods of transportation used to get to the theatre! As an artist presenting to fellow artists, it's important for me to have a command of imagery, as more creative ways of presenting data will be more actionable for them. 

After I graduate, I hope to work in theatre as a company manager, at an artist management firm, or in cultural policy!
