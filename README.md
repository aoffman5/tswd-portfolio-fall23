# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I really like data.  And I like visualizations.  So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

- List item #1
- List item #2
- List item #3

# Portfolio

Soon this will be full of data visualizations...

### Starting here... starting now!

We all have to start somewhere, so here is the first data visualization I've ever made in Flourish!
