# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.
> 
> Every year, Playbill, a theatre magazine perhaps most famous for its iconic programs, releases an annual report of the top 10 colleges and universities represented on Broadway from the previous year. The messaging of the best theatre schools is reinforced each year around June when Playbill releases another article on where that yearâ€™s Tony Award-winning actors, directors, and designers went to college. Many high school students hoping to *make it* in the business start their college search here- but what is the true cost of a musical theatre degree from one of these institutions? Who are these students fighting for the precious few spots at these schools? And how does the cost of training feed into the homogenization of actors on Broadway?
>
>  Every year, thousands of high school seniors across the United States, and a privileged few from countries across the globe, participate in what laymen could only describe as the closest possible experience to a human cattle-call: the musical theatre college audition process. From campus visits to testing to prescreens and the final audition, the process can cost thousands of dollars for an auditioner and their family, even without additional support such as coaching or a summer intensive program.
>
> I went through this process myself in 2017 for the 2018-19 school year, and I can tell you firsthand that it is certainly not a feat for the weak. I hope to be able to provide some of my own story as insight to this experience, but it's also incredibly important to note that each student's experience and circumstances are unique. I just want to shed light on SOME of the factors that impacted my experience that are common to all auditioners.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
I plan to use sources such as Playbill.com 
> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
