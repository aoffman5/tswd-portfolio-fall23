# Outline

Every year, thousands of high school seniors across the United States, and a privileged few from countries across the globe, participate in what laymen could only describe as the closest possible experience to a human cattle-call: the musical theatre college audition process. From campus visits to testing to prescreens and the final audition, the process can cost thousands of dollars for an auditioner and their family, even without additional support such as coaching or a summer intensive program. While, of course, institutional and governmental financial aid is available, these are not resources that are available to all students during their process and education.

Playbill, a theatre magazine perhaps most famous for its iconic programs that are featured in many an Instagram story, releases an annual report of the top 10 colleges and universities represented on Broadway from the previous year. The messaging of the best theatre schools is reinforced each year around June when Playbill releases another article on where that year’s Tony Award-winning actors, directors, and designers went to college. Many high school students hoping to *make it* in the business start their college search here- but what is the true cost of a musical theatre degree from one of these institutions?

And how does the cost of training feed into the homogenization of actors on Broadway? In fact, the industry is becoming almost as homogenized as the United States; an Actor’s Equity study shows that 63.95% of all union contracts from 2016-2019 went to white actors (Actor’s Equity Association 2023) compared to a 61.6% saturation of white people living in the US reported in the 2020 census (Jones et al. 2021). When you also take into account that the acceptance rate at Harvard's MEDICAL SCHOOL is higher than the acceptance rate of Michigan's musical theatre program (Edwards 2015), is the elitism fostered by the audition process having impacts elsewhere?

I went through this process myself in 2017 for the 2018-19 school year and ended up at another very selective university, and I can tell you firsthand that it is certainly not a feat for the weak. I hope to be able to provide some of my own story as insight into this experience, but it's also incredibly important to note that each student's experience and circumstances are unique. I just want to shed light on SOME of the factors that impacted my experience that are common to all auditioners.

## Project Structure
> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

I plan to tell my story in three parts. 

### The Cost to Get Seen
First, I want to find a way to illustrate the common expenses a musical theatre college auditioner will have to incur on top of typical college application fees (separate audition fees, travel, coaching, dance clothes, printed headshots). I plan to illustrate this through my own journey and comparing it to the costs of applying to other "prestigious" universities with similar acceptance rates (Ivy Leagues, MIT, etc).

### How to Stay in The Room Where It Happens
Next, I want to outline annual attendance costs at the top 10 schools represented on Broadway in the most recent Broadway season. For the purposes of an equal playing field, I will end up swapping out Yale for one of the honorable mention schools on the list as Yale is a Master's program.  

### Are These Programs Creating More Problems?
Finally, I want to shed light on the issues of representation in the industry and how some of the barriers present in the audition process are contributing to these inequities. With the end of affirmative action, specialized programs that rely on diversity as a recruiting tool will be forced to face the music. Which of these prestigious schools will remain spaces where culture and diversity can thrive? "Success" is looking more and more white, with 80% of the lead roles in musicals and 90% of the lead roles in plays being played by white actors in the 2018-19 season (AAPAC 2021).

First, I want to use a pictogram to represent the amount of Tony Award winners from the last five years, but I am debating if I want to break it down by school or by the "top 10" schools versus elsewhere. 

My call to action would be to the administrations of these schools to re-evaluate the costs of their screening and application processes and to patrons of the arts to invest in the future of musical theatre by donating to an organization like The Fund for College Auditions. 

# Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.  

Here are some rough visualizations I've created in Flourish and Infogram that I'm planning to polish to accurately represent the data. 

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
I plan to use sources such as Playbill.com 
> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 
> I plan to use Flourish and Infogram to build out my data visualizations. I then plan to use Shorthand to thread the whole story together and publish my final project.
