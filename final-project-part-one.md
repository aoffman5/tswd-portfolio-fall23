# Outline

>  Every year, thousands of high school seniors across the United States, and a privileged few from countries across the globe, participate in what laymen could only describe as the closest possible experience to a human cattle-call: the musical theatre college audition process. From campus visits to testing to prescreens and the final audition, the process can cost thousands of dollars for an auditioner and their family, even without additional support such as coaching or a summer intensive program. While, of course, institutional and governmental financial aid is available, these are not resources that are available to all students during their process and education. 
> 
> Playbill, a theatre magazine perhaps most famous for its iconic programs that are featured in many an Instagram story, releases an annual report of the top 10 colleges and universities represented on Broadway from the previous year. The messaging of the best theatre schools is reinforced each year around June when Playbill releases another article on where that year’s Tony Award-winning actors, directors, and designers went to college. Many high school students hoping to *make it* in the business start their college search here- but what is the true cost of a musical theatre degree from one of these institutions? And how does the cost of training feed into the homogenization of actors on Broadway? In fact, the industry is becoming more homogenized than the United States is as a whole; an Actor’s Equity study shows that 63.95% of all union contracts from 2016-2019 went to white actors compared to a 60.32% saturation of white people living in the US (Actor’s Equity Association 2022). When you also take into account that the acceptance rate at Harvard's MEDICAL SCHOOL is higher than the acceptance rate of Michigan's musical theatre program (Edwards 2015),

> I went through this process myself in 2017 for the 2018-19 school year and ended up at another school with a 2% acceptance rate, and I can tell you firsthand that it is certainly not a feat for the weak. I hope to be able to provide some of my own story as insight to this experience, but it's also incredibly important to note that each student's experience and circumstances are unique. I just want to shed light on SOME of the factors that impacted my experience that are common to all auditioners.

## Project Structure
> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

I plan to tell my story in three parts. 

### The Cost to Get Seen
First, I want to find a way to illustrate the common expenses a musical theatre college auditioner will have to incur on top of typical college application fees (separate audition fees, travel, coaching, dance clothes, printed headshots). 

### How to Stay in The Room Where It Happens
Next, I want to outline the costs of annual attendance at the top 10 schools represented on Broadway in the most recent Broadway season. 

### Are These Programs Creating More Problems?
Finally, I want to shed light on the issues of representation in the industry, and how some of the barriers present in the audition process are contributing to these inequities. With the end of affirmative action, specialized programs that rely on diversity as a recruiting tool will be forced to face the music. Which of these prestigious schools will remain spaces where culture and diversity can thrive?

My call to action would be to the administrations of these schools to re-evaluate the costs of their screening and application processes, as well as to patrons of the arts to invest in the future of musical theatre by donating to an organization like The Fund for College Auditions. 

# Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
I plan to use sources such as Playbill.com 
> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 
> I feel like I have gotten really comfortable with Flourish over the course, so I plan to use it to build out my data visualizations. I also might use Infogram to create some of my more pictorial/artistic visualizations. I then plan to use Shorthand to thread the whole story together and publish my final project.
